About Kolonel Panic's Automator Pack
===============

This is a collection of useful Automator services for Mac OS X:

* Open With Text Edit - right-click an item in the Finder, and select this menu item to open it with TextEdit regardless of its type
* Shorten URL - right-click some editable text (e.g., in Safari's location bar), and select this item to shorten the URL using the selected service (goo.gl by default); the short URL is copied to the clipboard and also replaces the selected text

(Open Terminal Here is obsolete because of the new built-in services in El Capitan.)

If you need to change any of the default behaviours, edit the workflows in /Library/Services/.

A installer for the old versions is available [here](https://github.com/kolpanic/Automator-Pack/releases).

It was developed by Karl Moskowski (aka [@kolpanic](http://twitter.com/kolpanic)) and released under the BSD license.
